# OtterMage Clock
this clock is created by me, by the help of a youtube tutorial for the hands movement (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki0XXrlKlHY), I made the clock face in GIMP, the otter image is by my friend 0EndlessDreamer0 (https://twitter.com/0EndlessDreamer), the Digital display uses variants of the DSEG7 and DSEG14 font families (https://www.keshikan.net/fonts-e.html), license provided.
